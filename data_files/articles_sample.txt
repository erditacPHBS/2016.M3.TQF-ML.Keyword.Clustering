One theory posits that people were, and continue to be, ashamed to voice support for President Trump and his policies in phone interviews, making online polling a superior method for accurately capturing public opinion. In a new report released last week, the Pew Research Center investigated that possibility, conducting the same survey with polling samples both online and over the phone. The experiment does not support the embarrassed-Trump-supporter theory. Pew reported: Overall, the survey experiment did not find significant mode differences in overall opinion about Trump or many of his signature policy positions. The web mode yielded estimates that were 1.8 percentage points more supportive of Trump and his policy positions, on average, than estimates from the phone mode. The differences ranged from 0 to 8 percentage points. In total, four of the 27 differences observed were statistically significant using conventional testing for opinion polls.";"Were_the_polls_wrong_on_Trump_because_people_were_afraid_to_admit_they_liked_him?";"2017-04-09 09:32:34";"2017-04-07 01:49:00";"a491529740";21;1

The president needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different, Paul said.
